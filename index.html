                Help people embrace their vulnerability through self-portrait making </p>
            <p>
                This design is an interactive installation aimed at enabling participants to 
                create self-portraits guided by their childhood memories. This project draws inspiration from 
                the modern artwork that explores self-image and the therapeutic effect of art therapy, aiming 
                to help people accept their vulnerable feelings through introspection and creative activity. 
                To achieve this, expert interviews with professionals and exploration with generative models 
                were conducted to gather insights and inform the design process. The installation incorporates 
                prompting guidance that evoke personal childhood memories, fostering an emotional connection and 
                self-reflection. The findings indicates that the installation succeeded in providing playable 
                experiences and eliciting positive emotions for people, which is very beneficial in cultivating 
                self-acceptance and helping people embrace their vulnerability.</br>

                <div style="z-index: 100; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Painting, with its extensive history, stands out as a </br>
                    particularly popular medium for self-portraits. "Man in </br>
                    a Red Turban" by Jan van Eyck (1433) (Fig. 1) is often </br>
                    considered one of the earliest examples of a panel </br>
                    self-portrait.[9] The portrait is notable for its </br>
                    remarkable attention to detail, capturing realistic </br>
                    textures like the turban, and the meticulous portrayal </br>
                    of the man's facial features[15]. </br></br>
                    Frida's “self-portrait with cropped hair” (1940).(Fig. 2)</br>
                    Self- portraits can be very emotionally expressive, </br>
                    serving as a format for artists to convey their </br>
                    identities, and momentary emotions, or engage in social </br>
                    commentary. In this particular self-portrait, Kahlo </br>
                    diverges from her typical depictions, shedding the </br>
                    feminine attributes often present in her work, such </br>
                    as traditional embroidered Tehuana dresses or flowers </br>
                    in her hair. Instead, she boldly presents herself in a </br>
                    loose-fitting man's suit with a short-cropped haircut. </br>
                    The floor is strewn with locks of her hair, and she </br>
                    holds a pair of shears across her lap. This androgynous </br>
                    portrayal is thought to reflect Kahlo's bisexuality and </br>
                    her response to a divorce from her husband [23]</br></br></div>

                    Self-portraits extend beyond paintings </br>

                    #153" (1985). (Fig. 3) This photograph is </br>
                    seen as an exploration of pop culture </br>
                    clichés related to women, delving into the </br>
                    historical and contemporary roles of women</br> 
                    in society. It serves as a reflection of </br>

                    As a similar medium to photograph, self-</br>
                    portraits are also created in videos. An </br>

                <p>
                The therapeutic function of self-portraits is obvious, establishing a close connection between self-portraiture and 
                therapy. </br>
                - <b style="color: #7176D2;">Self-portrait as a kind of art is often produced by the raw material “emotions”. </b> As the subjects of their own 
                artistic creations, we become unavoidably vulnerable, people are forced to think about how they want to be presented 
                in the portrait, and that elicits self-awareness and a process of self-reflection.</br>
                - The inner dialogue that takes place in front of the camera or the canvas or the recorder etc. mirrors the internal 
                processes encountered in therapy — <b style="color: #7176D2;">self-perception, self-questioning, judgment, 
                thoughtful contemplation, and acceptance</b>.</br>
                - Visual, audio, or text-based self-portraits (as opposed to a self-image existing solely in the mind) are 
                indispensable. They serve as tangible reflections on various aspects of one's being. <b style="color: #7176D2;">Creating a 
                self-portrait may unveil a hidden self</b> and having a self-portrait that people can reflect on later might provide a new perspective on 
                viewing themselves so that they can discover different facets of themselves.</br>
                - It's also obvious that every self-portrait is always <b style="color: #7176D2;">a form of performance</b>. Individuals engage in a 
                deliberate "performance" to present a desired image, which resembles role-playing in theatrical dramas. The unique combination of 
                self-subjectivity and dramatic features in self-portraiture holds a particular promise in addressing issues related to 
                self-image and feelings of vulnerability.</br>

                The yellow panel's buttons and rotary switches let users edit the portrait. The 'regenerate' button 
                prompts GPT to create a new text portrait. The 'photograph' button freezes the webcam after a 5-second 
                countdown; pressing it again unfreezes the frame. The 'back to beginning' button resets the webpage.
